This repository is associated with the paper titled "Is majority voting in the best 
interest of the majority?" (under review). The paper investigates the 
majoritarian accuracy of majority voting: which refers to the probability that it 
succeeds in selecting the alternative that is in the best interest of the majority. 
I use an agent-based model to explore the impact of imperfect competence and social 
influence on majority voting. The agents are placed on influence networks that are 
generated in a natural way, without the assumption that powerful minorities manipulate 
the network structure. Surprisingly, in these circumstances, there is a considerable 
risk that majority voting fails to track the majorityâ€™s interests. Moreover, my
statistical analysis suggests that the competences of the minority and the majority 
and the proportional influence of the minority are strong predictors, while, 
surprisingly, the relative size of the minority is not.

This repository contains the code for the agent-based model and simulations, for 
producing some figures, and for the statistical analysis. To get a feel for the 
agent-based model, click the picture below:

## 1. Setup
To run the project, you first need to install the required packages
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Simulation
1. To get a feel for the agent-based model, you can check out the
[jupyter notebook](NotebookWalkthrough.ipynb), which includes some network 
visualizations, by either opening the 
[pages](https://heinduijf.github.io/MajorityVotingCollectiveAccuracy/) or by running
```commandline
jupyter-notebook NotebookWalkthrough.ipynb
```
Running the notebook will create several html files in the folder `www` with 
visualizations of agent-based models.

2. To run the simulations and generate the data, run the script
```commandline
python main.py
```
which will create a csv file `data/clean.csv`, a collection of communities in the 
folder `data/communities`, and a README file with the parameter settings for the 
simulation in `data/README.csv`.

3. To generate the figures, run the script
```commandline
python figures.py
```
which will create a folder `new_figures` containing all the figures. 

4. To run the statistical analysis, run the script
```commandline
python statistics.py
```
which will create several csv files in the folder `stats` with the results of the 
statistical analysis.  

## 3. Organization of the project

### The agent-based model: `community.py`
The central class `Community` is defined in `community.py`. A `Community` is an 
*agent-based model* consisting of a network of agents, and it can be used to compute 
the estimated accuracy of a given community. The networks are generated with homophilic 
and preferential attachment. 

### Jupyter notebook: `NotebookWalkthrough.ipynb`
The jupyter notebook walks you through the stages of the agent-based model 
`Community` using some network visualizations. To minimize the amount of code in the 
notebook, some scripts are stored in `scripts/notebook.py`, which is run in one of the 
initial notebook cells. 

### Simulations: `simulation.py`
The central class `Simulation` and method `Simulation.run()` is defined in 
`simulation.py`, the method produces the csv file `data/clean.csv`. The method 
`Simulation.run()` runs a simulation consisting of generating `number_of_communities` 
communities and estimating the accuracy of each community by running 
`number_of_voting_simulations` voting simulations.  

### Figures: `figures.py`
The script `figures.py` creates a folder `new_figures` containing all the 
figures. The folder `generate_figures` contains the scripts that generate 
figures. Each script in that folder is associated with one of the figures. 

### Statistical analysis: `statistics.py`
The script `statistics.py` runs the statistical analysis that generates several csv 
files in  the folder `stats`. The folder `stats` contains scripts that generate the 
csv files. Each script in that folder is associated with one of the csv files.  

## 4. Runtime limitations
1. Runtime can be an issue for `Simulation.run()`. To run the simulation (with 
parameters `number_of_communities = 10 ** 5` and
`number_of_voting_simulations = 10 ** 5`), we used a virtual machine with 16 cores 
and 64 GB RAM, which took approximately 5 days to finish. 

2. Runtime can also be a minor issue for two scripts in the folder 
`generate_figures`, which are also included in the script `figures.py`. We ran these 
scripts on a basic laptop (2 cores 8 GB RAM). 
   1. The script `figure_accuracy_homophily.py`) takes approximately 10 minutes 
   (with parameters `number_of_communities=200` and `number_of_voting_simulations=200`). 
   2. The script `figure_distribution_in_degree.py` takes approximately 20 minutes to 
      finish (for 10**5 communities).
